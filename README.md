# PDF-to-Speak
Developed an online platform to convert PDF files to text or audio and save them as per the desire of the user.
Utilised Python modules such as PyPDF2 (to execute PDF in the program) and pyttsx3 ( to play sound).
After finishing each page of the PDF, the application speaks the page and displays cleaned text.
